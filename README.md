# CITE-seq_Analysis
Code for using Drop-seq tools and a custom alignment script in order to quantify the digital expression for the ADT library.
Geared for now towards lab-mates at the Broad Institute.

The list of commands in cmds_list.txt should take you through the whole process. Please let me know if you find errors (or just fix them here yourself!).

FYI, I did try first using a bunch of standard alignment tools instead of writing a custom script, but they were really not set up for the use case I had and just broke. Also, as an alternative, the Satija lab has some CITE-seq analysis scripts. They did not work for us, but they might work for you.
